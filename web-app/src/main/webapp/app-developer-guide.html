<h3>Tamil Application Developer Guide</h3>

<p>This guide details the specification of APIs provided by this platform.</p>

<p>Today many IT engineers write Tamil related applications using variety of technologies. But, It is unlikely they are
    re-used
    by another developer to build more on top of what is already done.
    If an application developer wants to do simple operations such as searching, replacing and sorting of Tamil texts,
    it is
    a nightmare.
    It is to be noted that the Tamil character representation provided by Unicode consortium is so unnatural to Tamil
    that it makes almost impossible to use standard APIs (say, java.lang.String from Java)
    from any programming language to perform those operations. I sense that we need another layer that hides all these
    complexities for the application developers.
    That api layer should allow the application developers to focus on what they do rather than to deal with the
    erroneous
    representation of Tamil characters. </p>

<p> This platform is intended to provide services from simple ones such as Tamil Dictionary, transliteration to most
    complicated services such as speech to text and translation from and to English. Yes. There is a long way to go.
    This platform is very young.</p>

<p>Today, we have தமிழகராதி, கலைச்சொல்லகராதி, இலக்கியங்களிலிருந்து சொல்லைத்தேடும் பயன்மிகள் hosted in different
    websites.
    However, They are done in such a way that is mostly useful only for human but to another program. I believe we
    are
    in
    an Era where a computer program is also one potential consumer of the internet and hence of all Tamil resources on
    the internet. I want to create such awareness.
    This platform should provide integration with those resources in the background without affecting the applications
    hosted on this.
    Tamil has to go beyond writing and reading a post in a Blog or Facebook.

<h4>
    Who should read this guide?
</h4>

<p>This guide is intended for application developers who want to write simple Tamil related applications that can assist
    Tamil
    development on the internet. Someone with passion for Tamil should be able to try on this.
    Application developers also bring requirements to the platform. Much of the system level complexities that are not
    directly related to the goals of an application are to be
    handled by the platform. The platform is just young and we should be able to support services one by one. An
    application developer also can contribute to the platform.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, the platform code is available at <a href="https://github.com/velsubra/Tamil">github</a>.
</p>

<h4>What technologies are required to develop an app?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS30</li>
    <li>Javascript or JQuery for client side scripting</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy for server side (Java) scripting</a></li>

</ol>
<p>One can expose a ReST API within the application by writing server side scripts. More scripting may be supported
    depending on the feasibility. Application developers also can publish Javascript APIs for other applications to
    consume.</p>

<h4>What is an application on this platform?</h4>

<p>An application in this platform is a bunch of resources (html5, javascript, groovy scripts) doing one or or more
    Tamil related
    tasks. An application is identified with a name. An application while being created (or cloned) can be secured
    against a code. The security code is required to make changes in it. However, anyone can view the application code.

    One should be able to create and publish new ReST APIs implemented using Groovy (ie Java). Those apis can be used by
    another application.
</p>

<p>
    A sophisticated editor for Tamil that does spell checking, gives suggestions and performs auto complete can be done
    as an
    application.
    Another application can take வெண்பா as input and validate its correctness. We can write applications that shows
    various
    புணர்ச்சிவிதிகள் for students and Tamil scholars.
    We will be able to write more complicated applications (say reading Tamil text) in the future.

</p>

<a id="access-api"></a>
<h4>Where are the available platform APIs?</h4>

<p>
    The Java API is published <a target="_blank" href="apidocs/index.html">here</a>. The starting point for using this
    API will be
    <a href="apidocs/tamil/lang/TamilFactory.html">TamilFactory</a>. These can be used in the groovy scripts to expose
    ReST apis from an application.

</p>

<p>
    The JavaScript API is published <a target="_blank" href="jsdocs/index.html">here</a>. The below snippet can be
    copied into the HTML resource.
    <pre>
     &lt;script src="${R_JQUERY_JS_PATH}" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
     &lt;script src="${R_PLATFORM_JS_PATH}" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>

     &lt;script type='text/javascript'>//&lt;![CDATA[

            var trans = TamilFactory.createTransliterator(); // This can be cached for repeated usages.
            var tamil_text = trans.transliterate('vaNakkam').tamil;  // This will return  வணக்கம்

        //]]>
     &lt;/script>
    </pre>

</p>

<a id="create-app"></a>
<h4>How to create my first application?</h4>

<p>It will be very straight forward to create a simple application and get a taste of it.
    If you already know (javascript and groovy)scripting and html5, it will be a little more fun to try new things with
    the given set of APIs. After getting familiarised with the below terms and concepts, you can go <a
            href="app-manager-list-apps.html">here</a> to add a new app.
</p>

<h5>Application Name</h5>

<p>You need an application name. This should be a <b> simple name without any special character.</b> Every application
    will get an unique application access URL.</p>
<h5>Application Management Security Code</h5>

<p>This security code can be given to the application, only when it is <b> created or cloned (.ie save as another
    app) </b>. Secured
    application needs the security code to be presented to be modified. All application code can be viewed by anyone.


</p>

<a id="app-inheritance"></a>
<h5>Application Resource Inheritance</h5>

<p>
    Applications can inherit resources from one or more of its parent applications. Multiple parents should be separated
    by comma.
    Inherited resources can be
    overridden by creating a resource by the same name. ie) if a resource is defined by an application, then that takes
    precedence
    over the resources from its parent applications. Parent applications themselves can inherit resources from other
    applications.

</p>

<p>
    One of the following resource search orders can be specified for a child application. Circular inheritance is just
    ignored. This order does not matter if the application just has a single or no parent.
<ol>
    <li><b>Breadth First</b> - In this case, the resources from the immediate parent(s) are given precedence over the
        the
        resources that the
        parent applications themselves might have inherited.
    </li>
    <li><b>Depth First(Pre Order)</b> - In this case the resources from the first parent along with whatever that parent
        has
        inherited through its search order
        are given precedence over the resources from the second parent listed.
    </li>
</ol>

This feature can be used to create a base (parent) application against a javascript framework or library. Other
applications that depend on
that javascript framework can extend the base application.
Inherited resources can be accessed through all the applications that had inherited. All the static macros, if any, are
resolved against the application(base) that had defined that resource than the one(child) that inherited. However, all
the dynamic
variables (e.g query params) are passed to the base resource.
</p>
<a id="external-link"></a>
<h5>External Resource Access Links</h5>
<p>
    External resource (say a javascript framework) does not need to be uploaded here. Instead, the base url of the
    project can be entered. Now, when a resource for an app is accessed and <b>if the resource is not locally found</b>, the
    resource will be resolved against the base url. The resource can be returned through the application access url.

    All the external resources are considered to be local. So they all comply with the application inheritance orders.


</p>
Example:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>set <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/master">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/master</a>  as one of the the External url roots
        for your app.</li>
    <li>Create a simple html page say test.html</li>
    <li>You can now  import  the javascript <b>samples/go.js</b> in the test.html as the url <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/master/samples/go.js">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/master/<b>samples/go.js</b></a> exists remotely.</li>
    <li>Yes. You would not need to localize any resources to the app. The resource <b>samples/go.js</b> can be treated as though it is an internal resource.</li>
    <li>ie), This resource can be accessed using the following url pattern ${Your app root in the Tamil platform}/<b>samples/go.js</b> will successfully resolve to the remote source. </li>

</ul>
 The url could be file:// path as well. That will be useful when you run the Tamil platform locally.
</p>
<hr/>

<h5>External Library  reference in Groovy scripts</h5>
<p>
   Java libraries from maven project can be referenced by the application such that classes from those libraries can be imported into groovy scripts.

</p>
<hr/>

<p>
    Creation of an application typically has the following life-cycle.
<ul>
    <li>It is created with a temporary name and without security code. The default page index.html is created with some
        default content that can be modified later.
    </li>
    <li>Various resources (html, css and script) files are created.</li>
    <li>The application is tested by accessing it.</li>
    <li>After the required testing, the application is <b>cloned</b> with the <b>required name </b> and with a <b>security
        code</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Application url is shared.</li>
</ul>

</p>


<p>
    Modification of an application is typically done in the following steps.
<ul>
    <li>The application is cloned to a temporary name without a security code. This will copy all the application
        resources, making it ready for editing.
    </li>
    <li>Various resources (html, css and script) files are modified, deleted or created.</li>
    <li>The application is tested by accessing it.</li>
    <li>After the required testing, The original application is deleted by providing the previously secured security
        code.
    </li>
    <li>The temporary application is <b>cloned</b> with the <b>original name </b> and with a <b>security
        code</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Delete the temporary application.</li>
    <li>Application url is preserved.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<hr/>

<a id="create-resource"></a>
<h4>How to create resources within an application?</h4>

<p>Application resources can be created just after the application is created.</p>
<h5>Resource Name</h5>

<p>Every resource has a name. <b> This name can include / to create nested resources</b>. That is the mechanism to
    create sub
    directories. E.g) html/a.html , js/a.js, server/groovy/first.gv are some examples valid resource names. Every
    resource has a <b>type</b> that must be selected after the resource is created. This can be selected by clicking the
    resource name once it is created. That would take to the page that allows editing of the resource content. The
    resource type can be selected there. The extension used in the resource name does not matter. The type chosen
    matters
    when the resource is being accessed.
</p>

<p>
    E.g)When a groovy script is created and saved, it is parsed and the errors are reported if there is any parsing
    error. When a groovy script url is accessed, the script is executed and the output (the value that the script
    returns) of the script is returned via the
    back channel of the http request. Please see "Guidelines for writing Groovy scripts" section to know the guidelines
    for creating groovy
    scripts.
</p>
<hr/>

<a id="groovy-guidelines"></a>
<h4>Guidelines for writing Groovy scripts</h4>

<p>Groovy scripts typically will use the Java APIs provided by this platform to perform certain action and return a
    value. Accessing the groovy resource via http(s) request will cause the script to execute. The script can read input
    parameters from the
    request accessing it.</p>

<p>
    Tamil platform Apis
    <pre>
    E.g)
    import tamil.lang.*;
    import tamil.util.*;
    import tamil.lang.api.trans.*;
    </pre>
and other standard Java APIs
<pre>
    such as

    import java.util.*;
    import javax.ws.rs.core.*;
    import javax.servlet.http.*;
    import org.json.*;

</pre>
can be imported and used in the script.
</p>
<b>Calling things like System.exit(int) or any other insecure APIs will cause security exception.</b>

<p>The following are the implicit variables that the script have access to.
<ol>
    <li>R_ - <a
            href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html">HttpServletRequest</a>
        that is incoming. Any parameter that comes through the request can be read via this. However, There are other
        quick
        direct variables to certain part of the request.
    </li>
    <li>
        R_PATH - <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a> with the value of
        the resource name.
    </li>
    <li>R_BODY - <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html"> InputStream </a> to the
        body of the http request. Note: Multi-part request has to be handled via R_ only.
    </li>
    <li>R_QP_<b>param</b> -<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a> with the
        value of the query parameter with name <b>param</b>.
        E.g) if you access https://... ../myapp/myscript.gv?word=தமிழ் , the variable R_QP_word will be available to te
        script with the value "தமிழ்" (quotes are not in the value).

    </li>
    <li>R_APP_NAME - <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a> with the name
        of the application.
    </li>
    <li>R_LOG - <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">PrintWriter</a> that can be
        used to write log messages for the request. Note: This is not to write the response. However, if the script
        returns R_LOG, the text written to the stream is returned via the back channel of the response. Please see the
        return types for more information.
    </li>
    <li>More directly bound variables will be added ....</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    The following return types are recognized by the platform.
<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.json.org/java/">org.json.JSONObject</a> - This will be converted to a <b> application/json;
        charset=utf-8 </b>
        response to the caller that made the http request. Likewise, JSONArray and JSONString can be returned. Status
        code will be <b>200</b>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html">javax.ws.rs.core.Response</a> -
        this is used to return the custom response. In this case, the groovy script completely <b> decides the http
        response
        status code , content-type and contents. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        R_LOG - The text written to R_LOG which is a <a
            href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">PrintWriter</a> is returned with
        the status code of <b> 200</b>. The content type will be <b> text/plain; charset=utf-8 </b>. Returning other
        instance of <a
            href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">PrintWriter</a> is not applicable
        to this.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a
                href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html">InputStream or byte[]</a> - The
        content is returned with status code of <b> 200</b> and with the content type <b>application/octet-stream</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        null - This will cause the status of <b> 202</b> being returned with no body to the client.
    </li>
    <li>All other objects including <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String</a>
        - object.toString()
        will be returned as a
        <b> text/plain; charset=utf-8 </b> response to the client. Status code will be <b>200</b>.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Any un-handled exception from script execution will be translated to a status of <b>500</b> with the content-type
    <b>
        text/plain; charset=utf-8 </b>. The body of the response will be message contained in the exception along with
    line number of the script that ran into exception.
</p>
<hr/>

<a id="pre-processing"></a>
<h4>Pre-processing of a resource</h4>

<p>Resources are pre-processed while being accessed or pre-hand. The following patterns are recognized by this platform
    for all the
    resources during pre-processing.
    <br/> <b>Note:</b> Groovy
    script is pre-processed before it is compiled (ie parsed). So the dynamic patterns will not be resolved as a
    property. Instead, those are exposed as implicit variables. Patterns with small letters such as R_QP_name indicates
    that they are
    dynamic patterns where "name" is a dynamic portion of that pattern.
<ol>
    <li> T{...} - used to inline the transliterated English text to Tamil. T{thamizh} would be replaced with தமிழ் when
        the resource is accessed.
    </li>
    <li> ${...} - used to inline the request specific properties.
        <ul>
            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_PATH} - The resource name.</li>
            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_APP_NAME} - The application name.</li>
            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_PLATFORM_CONTEXT} - The context root of the platform
                application.(/tamil typically).
            </li>
            <li><b>Dynamic:</b> ${R_QP_name} - The value of the query parameter "name" - Since it is a dynamic pattern,
                this wont
                resolve
                in groovy script as a property. However, R_QP_name will be an implicit variable in groovy
                scripts.
            </li>

            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_JQUERY_JS_PATH} - The path to jquery javascript file.
             <pre>
           E.g)
           &lt;script src="${R_JQUERY_JS_PATH}" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>

                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_PLATFORM_JS_PATH} - The path to the <a
                    href="js/api/tamil-platform-api-1.1.js">platform javascript file</a>. The value could be the
                relative
                path
                based on the the resource using it.
                This is typically used in the application HTML files. Please also include JQuery javascript file.
                <pre>
           E.g)
           &lt;script src="${R_JQUERY_JS_PATH}" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>

            </li>
            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_PLATFORM_CSS_PATH} - The path to the <a
                    href="css/tamil-platform-1.1.css">platform css file</a>. The value could be the
                relative
                path
                based on the the resource using it.
                This is typically used in the application HTML files.

            </li>

            <li>Static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ${R_INJECT_PLATFORM_APPLET} - The <a
                    href="apidocs/tamil/lang/api/applet/AppletTamilFactory.html">Platform Applet</a> code that is
                injected.It is to be used in HTML resources.
                <pre>
           E.g)
            ${R_INJECT_PLATFORM_APPLET} can be  dropped anywhere in the HTML.
                    The applet is only for Javascripts invoking some Java APIs. It shall not display anything.
